Eclipse 2024


April 8, 2024 - The path of totality begins in Mexico, passing
                through Texas as it moves northeast to Maine.

                "We are in a great location to see it, and that
                one has 4 minutes, just over 4 minutes, of totality."

                --Think this is referring to Saluki Stadium on the
                  campus of Southern Illinois University in Carbondale,
                  Illinois (SIU).

                From global map looks like central Texas may be a
                great viewing location.


Aug 21, 2017 -  2 minutes and 38 seconds of totality 


The same may be true in 2024.  On April 8, 2024 (another Monday),
the moon's shadow will sweep across Mexico and North America.  The
path of totality begins in Mexico, passing through Texas as it moves
northeast to Maine.
...
On Monday (Aug. 21), Carbondale saw 2 minutes and 38 seconds of
totality, close to the greatest duration (2 minutes and 40 seconds,
a few miles away).  The planning for Monday's total solar eclipse
began in 2014.
...
"We are in a great location to see it, and that one has 4 minutes,
just over 4 minutes, of totality."
...
To be clear, Earth will see total solar eclipses before 2024.

The next one will occur July 2, 2019, and will pass over South America,
with totality visible from parts of the southern Pacific Ocean, Chile
and Argentina.  Others will occur in 2020 over South America and in
2021 over Antarctica, according to maps by veteran eclipse scientist
Fred Espenak.
